                        <h3>The Rundown</h3>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Background: </strong>After an initially shaky start in the IPL, Mumbai Indians have evolved into the most successful IPL franchise under the captaincy of Rohit Sharma, winning 5 IPL titles in all (in 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, 2020). Their team building has been excellent, building champion teams with a balance of experience (Rohit Sharma, Lasith Malinga, Kieron Pollard), rejuvenated talents from other franchises (SuryaKumar Yadav, Quinton de Kock) newly discovered/nurtured talent (Bumrah, the Pandya brothers, Ishan Kishan). Mumbai also has excellent scouting, plucking up the likes of Marco Jansen before they had made a major mark on the international scene.
                            <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Retentions: Rohit Sharma (1600L), Jasprit Bumrah (1200L), SuryaKumar Yadav (800L), Kieron Pollard(600L) - </strong> Although Delhi Capitals complained about breaking up their team via the mega auction, Mumbai Indians likely had the strongest case to be aggreived from breaking up their champion team. The eyewatering sums last-years MI players fetched is testament to that: Ishan Kishan (1525L), Hardik Pandya (GT - 1500L), Krunal Pandya (825L), Trent Boult (RR 800L), Quinton de Kock (675L) among the leaders. Mumbai retained the best 4 under the circumstances with only potentially a SKY/IK switch in hindsight being a potential alternative<br><br>
                            <strong>Likely Starting XI</strong> Rohit Sharma (c), Ishan Kishan (wk), SuryaKumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Tim David(O), Kieron Pollard(O), Tymal Mills(O), Fabian Allen (O) Jaydev Unadkat, Jasprit Bumrah, Murugan Ashwin<br>
                            <strong>Immediate Bench</strong> Daniel Sams(for Fabian Allen), Mayank Markande (for Murugan Ashwin), Riley Meredith, Dewald Brevis(), <br>
                            <strong>Deeper reserves:</strong>Jofra Archer (after 2022),  Basil Thampo, Sanjay Yadav, Ramandeep Singh, Arun Juyal, Hrithik Shokeen, Rahul Buddhi, Arshad Khan, Anmolpreet Singh, Arjun Tendulkar  <br><br>
                            <strong>Auction Approach: </strong> Despite being a perennial contender, Mumbai's auction approach was very much focused on the future, clearly epitomized by its relentless pursuit of Jofra Archer (likely unavailable in 2022), Dewald Brevis(18yo) and Tim David(825L). Although the presence of 4 Indian first XI and strong foreign reserves will mean MI will be very strong in 2022, they will be absolutely terrifying in coming years with the availability of Jofra and development of talents like Brevis, David and Varma. If Mumbai can turn around the talented but (in IPL at least) underwhelming Jaydev Unadkat, their reign atop the IPL will be cemented.<br>
                            <strong>Foreign Imports: </strong>Mumbai spent heavily on foreign imports - Tim David (825L), Jofra Archer (800L), Dewald Brevis(300L), Daniel Sams (260L) leading the pack, with Tymal Mills (150L), Riley Meredith (100L) and Fabian Allen (75L) providing pace bowling and power hitting reserves to supplement the strong Indian core. If/when Archer returns to the IPL, Mumbai's fee of 800L for the express quick will look like a bargain buy.<br>
                            <strong>On the day</strong> Mumbai was extremely disciplined on day 1 - bidding sporadically, but only fighting hard to return Ishan Kishan. This left them with plenty of dry powder on day 2 which they employed to bully out challengers for Jofra Archer and Tim David.<br>
                            <strong>Best buy: Jofra Archer</strong> although expensive at 800L, the sheer pace and effectiveness of Jofra Archer in the IPL meant he would be one of the most valuable foreign players available, with only his injury and availability knocking him out of the marquee spot. If Archer had come to auction next year, he would likely be the most expensive buy, but Mumbai's day 1 discipline at the auction meant they could outmuscle competitors and potentially assemble the best pace bowling duo in the IPL in Bumrah and Archer<br>
                            <strong>Biggest Gamble: Tim David</strong> at 825L for an unproven foreign talent (although he has done brilliantly in the PSL) is a big gamble. With foreign batsmen being a relatively accessible commodity and proven talents like de Kock and Warner went for much less, it does seem a bit of stretch. Mumbai may have ended up with Archer for less than they expected, and David ended up the beneficiary, but Mumbai may have been better off spending the money on a proven Indian batsman to give them more options.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Verdict: 9/10. </strong>Another year, another well executed strategy from Mumbai Indians. They have beautifully balanced the competing demands of age vs potential, quality vs depth, continuity vs fresh blood, building for the present vs the future. Mumbai's team has 4 Indian national first XI players (ensuring regular competition at the highest level) and buttressed it with excellent foreign specialist t20 talent (making their IPL availability more likely due to fewer national demands). My only quibbles would be spending too much on foreign talent vs Indian talent - an extra experienced Indian player in the middle would have offered flexibility, but Mumbai ends up with a top 3 squad that will likely only get stronger in the coming years. <br>
                            <em>    Near term expectations:</em> With great leadership, an exceptionally strong first XI, strong continuity, talented specialists, and good reserves, Mumbai should be disappointed with anything other than a top two finish this year<br>
                            <em>    Long term verdict:</em> Mumbai will likely get even stronger in coming years, with the expected return of Jofra, and continued development of exciting young talents like Ishan Kishan, Dewald Brevis, Tim David and the number of young Indian reserves on the squad. Mumbai have also set themselves up for future mega auctions, with the range of ages in the squad meaning several young players will be hitting their prime just as more experienced players age out of theirs. <br>
