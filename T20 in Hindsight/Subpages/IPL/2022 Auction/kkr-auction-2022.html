                        <h3>The Rundown</h3>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Background: </strong> Despite a scintillating start to the IPL with Brendon McCullum's electrifying 158 in the very first IPL match, Kolkata Knight Riders struggled to make a mark in the first 3 seasons of the IPL, finishing 6th, 8th and 6th. They made the difficult decision to replace the legendary Sourav Ganguly (likely the worst 'Icon player') with Gautam Gambhir, which led to an immediate turnaround in their fortunes. The Gambhir led KKR made the playoffs in 2011, before winning titles outright in 2012 and 2014. After 2014, KKR remained a competitive and well run side without ever becoming truly great, never finishing worse than 5th in the league from 2015 to 2021. They made 3 consecutive appearances in 2016-2018 but could not advance to the final, before finally breaking their eliminator jinx in 2021 where they lost the final to a mighty CSK side. KKR has historically placed a premium on strong leadership (paying big for Gautam Gambhir and persisting with an out of form Eoin Morgan in 2021), spending big on foreign all-rounders to lend balance to the side (Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Pat Cummins) and being the strongest proponent of mystery spin (Sunil Narine, Varun Chakravarthy and Ajantha Mendis all played for KKR).
                            <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Retentions: Andre Russell (1200L), Venkatesh Iyer (800L), Varun Chakravarthy (800L), Sunil Narine (600L)</strong>  KKR went with the unusual strategy of retaining 2 overseas players, keeping Andre Russell and Sunil Narine. While some of the availability risk is mitigated by the fact both are T20 specialists and do not play other formats, it still uses 2 overseas slots. KKR's other retentions were used on Venatesh Iyer, arguably the find of IPL 2021, as well as mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy. Although the combined quartet agreed to lower salaries than called by the retention schedule, KKR's purse was still reduced by the full 4800L. The main question on retention likely involved choosing between the talented Shubman Gill and Sunil Narine, with KKR concluding likely correctly that Sunil Narine would have gone for more than Gill. KKR likely retained their best quartet but it is likely not as valuable as Mumbai or CSK's retained quartet. </strong><br><br>
                            <strong>Likely Starting XI</strong> Venkatesh Iyer, Ajinkya Rahane, Nitish Rana, Shreyas Iyer (c), Sam Billings (OWK), Andre Russell (O), Pat Cummins(O), Sunil Narine(O), Shivam Mavi, Umesh Yadav, Varun Chakravarthy<br>
                            <strong>Immediate Bench</strong> Tim Southee, Sheldon Jackson (for Sam Billings), Alex Hales <br>
                            <strong>Deeper reserves:</strong>Mohammad Nabi, Chamika Karunaratne, Baba Indrajith, Rinku Singh, Anukul Roy, Abhijeet Tomar, Pratham Singh, Rasikh Salam, Aman Khan, Ramesh Kumar, Ashok Sharma  <br><br>
                            <strong>Auction Approach: </strong> KKR came in hot and heavy early in the auction, fearlessly bidding for Shreyas Iyer (1225L), Pat Cummins (725L) and Nitish Rana (800L) early in Day 1, exhausting most of their purse on thier first 7 players. This meant that they had to be more circumspect through the rest of the auction, but they surprisingly still bid hard and won Shivam Mavi (725L). The remainder of the auction saw them fill out their bench, pick up overseas role players and specialists in Tim Southee, Alex Hales, Mohammad Nabi and Chamika Karunaratne at or near base price for great bargain values. KKR also showed a preference for keeping many of their stalwarts, bidding hard for the likes of Nitish Rana, Prasidh Krishna and Shivam Mavi <br>
                            <strong>Foreign Imports: </strong>KKR has had an unusual strategy on anchoring primarily around very highly paid overseas superstars like Russell, Cummins and Narine. They continued to follow that in 2022, getting 3 of their 4 overseas slots filled with their first 6 selections. They did get some excellent bargain buys later in the auction with Tim Southee Alex Hales and Mohammad Nabi at the end of day 2<br>
                            <strong>On the day</strong> Perhaps unsurprisingly given how agressively they went for their initial targets, KKR entered bids for the 2nd fewest number of players, with bids put in for only 38. When they did enter though, they followed through at a higher rate than anyone else in the auction, winning 55% of their bidding wars. In hindsight, given the early caution in the early rounds, KKRs early aggressive strategy likely paid off, as some of the crazy sums paid later for arguably weaker players showed- e.g. Is Pat Cummins with his all round skill and leadership ability really worth less than the more one-dimensional Mark Wood/Lockie Ferguson/Josh Hazlewood.<br>
                            <strong>Best buy: Shreyas Iyer</strong> Shreyas Iyer made headlines on day 1 for his eye-watering price of 1225L before Ishan Kishan eclipsed him later in the day, but despite his high price, he is a great buy as a versatile 27-year old strokemaker with an excellent record in all forms of cricket, and most critically has a calm and assured leadership presence. KKR will likely be especially thrilled with the buy given the high sums less accomplished players went for later in the auction as well as Iyer's Man-of-the-Series performance in the India-SL t20 series that immediately followed the auction. Picking up Ajinkya Rahane for 100L is an honorable mention - with the IPL format demanding at least 70 Indian starters, there is no question Rahane is among the top 70 Indian players even today - and his experience and leadership would be a tremendous asset to the KKR team. <br>
                            <strong>Biggest Gamble: Shivam Mavi</strong> at 725L was a bit of a stretch, given the sums many arguably superior Indian pacers went for before and after this buy. Mavi has never set the IPL on fire, didnt have a particularly memorable season in 2021 and doesnt look close to Indian national team selection. The likes of Chetan Sakariya, T Natarajan, Bhuveneshwar Kumar, Sandeep Sharma went for far less without attracting much attention from KKR.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Verdict: 6/10. </strong>KKR's "stars and scrubs" approach is very volatile, as we can see from their uneven IPL performances despite smart, thoughtful management. This was on display even last year as KKR languished at the bottom of the table for much of the tournament before getting hot and making a miraculous and unlikely surge to the finals at the end. However, with heavy reliance on the fragile Russell & Chakravarthy and the in-demand Pat Cummins, KKR will hope that their overseas stars remain available and in-form, their scouting unearths new young talent, and that the young talents they banked on (Iyer, Rana, Mavi) continue their development under the leadership of Iyer  <br>
                            <em>    Near term expectations:</em> KKR has a solid, balanced team, but at every level seem weaker than the strongest teams. There is definite talent in the XI, but KKR seem to be the team that would be most adversely affected by an injury to their core 7-8 players given their untested Indian reserves. If all goes well, KKR can expect to make it to the eliminators, but I would likely expect them to finish outside the final four<br>
                            <em>    Long term verdict:</em> The relatively weak Indian core and nearly fixed overseas lineup would mean KKR is unlikely to get much stronger in the upcoming mini-auctions. By the next mega-auction, the Iyer twins should still be in their prime, and hopefully Mavi and Varun will continue to justify KKR's faith, with Cummins being the likely overseas retention. At that point, KKR will hopefully invest more in its Indian core to get more consistent performances <br>
