                        <h3>The Rundown</h3>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Background: </strong>The defending champions CSK favor team continuity and experience over chasing/finding the next superstar. Led by the brilliant MS Dhoni who has led the same all-rounder heavy core, CSK has won more of its matches than any other team and is second only to Mumbai in titles. Going into the auction, Chennai faced the challenges of other teams poaching core members of its championship team, while trying to strike a balance between keeping the faith with its ageing core and finding new blood to take the franchise into the next decade.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Retentions: Ravindra Jadeja (1600L), Mahendra Singh Dhoni (1200L), Moeen Ali (800L), Ruturaj Gaikwad(600L) - </strong> Retentions for CSK focused on one thing - would Dhoni still want to play in the 2022 cycle? Dhoni had definitely slowed down from his world destroying ways with the bat, although he remained a brilliant stumper and captain. As such, once he decided to play, there was no question of CSK retaining him, despite his value as a team icon likely driving his value more than his cricketing skills at age 40. With that resolved, the other retentions were simple - Jadeja is in strong contention for most valuable IPL player (along with Bumrah and KL Rahul); Moeen was a revalation at CSK and Ruturaj has exceeded all expectations and grown into a stellar batsman. CSK would have wished they could have retained Chahar and Thakur as well.<br><br>
                            <strong>Likely Starting XI</strong>Ruturaj Gaikwad, Devon Conway(O), Moeen Ali (O), Robin Uthappa, Ambati Rayudu, Ravindra Jadeja, MS Dhoni, Deepak Chahar, Dwayne Bravo(O), Adam Milne (O), KM Asif <br>
                            <strong>Immediate Bench</strong> Shivam Dube(for Uthappa/Rayudu), Chris Jordan/Dwaine Pretorius(for Bravo/Milne), Tushar Deshpande <br>
                            <strong>Deeper reserves</strong> <br><br>
                            <strong>Auction Approach: </strong>Last dance vibes as Chennai focused on bringing its championship squad back together, but was selective in where it spent. <strong>Indian Core</strong>It was heavily focused on retaining its core Indian players - fighting tenaciously to retain Deepak Chahar(1400L) and Ambati Rayudu(675L), bidding deep for Shardul Thakur, and even extending bids for the likes of Robin Uthappa, KM Asif, Tushar Deshpande.<br>
                            <strong>Foreign Imports: </strong>The highest paid foreign player on the team was the veteran Super King Dwayne Bravo at 440 Lakh, although CSK did bid hard for Faf du Plessis and David Warner before ceding them to hungier franchises. Similar to prior years, CSK were able to get foreign specialists for lower prices late in the auction, with Devon Conway (100L) and Adam Milne(190L)/Chris Jordan(360L) expected to help bridge the losses of Faf Du Plessis (700L to BRC) and Josh Hazlewood(775L to BRC) respectively. Mitchell Santner (190L) was brought back, despite rarely getting a game for CSK; while Maheesh Theeksana (70L) and Dwaine Pretorius (50L) round out the foreign core. Dwaine Pretorius with his canny medium pace and power hitting down the order could be earmarked to rest/replace Dwayne Bravo as a like-for-like replacement.<br>
                            <strong>On the day</strong> Although Chennai usually sticks with the tried and tested, they were surprisingly enterprising on the day, putting in bids on more players (50) than any other team in the auction but backing away when the bids got too high (Faf, Thakur and Rahul Tewatia were good examples). This is generally a good approach as it gives you a good opportunity to cover bases or snap up a bargain replacement<br>
                            <strong>Best buy: Devon Conway</strong> at 100L seems a steal and a promising young option to replace the mighty Faf at the top of the order. With a charmed start to his international career, and a T20 average of 44(!) and a strike rate of 128 he is well suited to open the batting with Ruturaj Gaikwad<br>
                            <strong>Questionable buy: Dwayne Bravo</strong> at 440L seems a lot for a 39 year old fast bowling all rounder. While Bravo has battled away the ravages of time with canny cutters and sneaky slower balls at the death, how long can he continue to remain effective at the highest level?

                        <p>
                            <strong>Verdict: 8/10 </strong>Time goes on, the CSK team stays the same. While continuity and clarity of roles are great for getting off the blocks quickly, CSK will hope that age and lack of international playing experience does not hamper their ageing core (6 of their likely XI are over 33.<br>
                            <em>    Near term expectations:</em> With quality, continuity, and experience from top to bottom, exceptionally deep batting and varied bowling options, and brilliant leadership, CSK will be optimistic they can maintain their exceptional playoff and finals record<br>
                            <em>    Long term verdict:</em> Unless CSK can groom their young Indian bench to fill the deep shoes of Dhoni, Raina, Bravo, Rayudu and Uthappa, their prospects for 3-5 years on are not as clear. Still with their strong track record of developing talent, CSK will back itself to remain competitive<br>

                        <h3>Detailed Analysis</h3>
                        <h4>Long Term Team Building Themes</h4>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Keywords: </strong><em>Strong, stable leadership under captain Dhoni and coach Fleming; Focus on keeping core team together; Unafraid of age; Bat deep with multiple all-rounders; Overseas specialists at high impact spots; Disciplined, targeted spending at mini-auctions</em><br><br>
                            <strong>Thala: </strong> Chennai’s team identity starts with MS Dhoni, who is synonymous with the franchise, since he was purchased in the inaugural edition for a then record 1.5cr. Ever since, he has delighted CSK fans with his power-packed hitting, canny keeping and most importantly, cool-headed and astute leadership under pressure. While Dhoni’s batting skills showed signs of slowdown, his gloves and mind remain as sharp as ever.<br>
                            <strong>Loyalty to the core team: </strong> Most members of the current CSK team have been a part of the team for the better part of the past decade, with Dhoni and Suresh Raina having been with the team since its founding, while other core members have been repeatedly brought back despite other teams attempts to poach them at auctions or the consistent threats of loss of form and advancing age. Faf du Plessis, Ravindra Jadeja, Dwayne Bravo and Ambati Rayudu are other CSK long-timers who had been retained for years - even as they entered their late 30s. Although CSK often attracted the tag ‘Dad’s army’, the continuity provided by players who have played together for years has given CSK an edge in gelling quickly once the season starts, with CSK often jumping out to an early lead in the standings which helps bolster their near perfect record of making the playoffs (11 out of 12 times).<br>
                            <strong>Keeping the faith: </strong> CSK persists with their core players - typically waiting patiently even if players form dips for an extended period of time. Additionally, CSK does not fear persisting with older players - and so far the strategy has worked, with champion teams frequently featuring retired or older internationals such as Matthew Hayden, Mike Hussey, Shane Watson, Faf du Plessis, Dwayne Bravo, Dhoni, Rayudu or Robin Uthappa in recent years.<br>
                            <strong>Batdeep and bowling options aplenty:</strong> CSK has always been built around a core of strong all-rounders - from Albie Morkel /Raina in the early years, to Jadeja, Bravo, R Ashwin in the early ‘10s moving to a core of Jadeja, Bravo, Moeen Ali, Shardul Thakur and Deepak Chahar. The batting depth has meant the top and middle order can play with a freedom that other teams can only envy. When fielding, the all-rounder heavy core Dhoni typically had six or seven competent bowling options to call upon, which has helped him match-up effectively even against the most dangerous teams.<br>
                            <strong>Indian core, quality foreign specialists: </strong> - Chennai has a surprisingly straightforward and consistent formula. Spend most of your money on the Indian core in the Mega Auctions and pick up Test-caliber experienced foreign specialists for key roles such as opening batsman (Hayden/Hussey/McCullum/Watson/DuPlessis) or strike bowler (Bollinger/Hilfenhaus/Hazlewood) who are often acquired at or near base price <br>
                            <strong>Big buys only at mini-auctions: </strong>Chennai rarely breaks the bank for players at mega-auctions, but pursues a different strategy at mini-auctions where they are willing to go all-out for potential difference makers (Freddie Flintoff/Ravindra Jadeja/Moeen Ali/Sam Curran/K Gowtham)
