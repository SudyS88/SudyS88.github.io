                            <strong>The basics: </strong> To win a T20 match, you need to score more runs than your opponent by the end of the match. The resources teams have to manage in their quest to score runs are primarily balls (120 balls per innings) and wickets. T20 is however, asymmetrical in that the team batting second knows exactly what target it needs to chase down and can adjust its tactics and approach accordingly (of course this applies somewhat to the team bowling second as well via field placements, usage of strike bowlers, lines and lengths etc.). <br>
                            Additionally, bowlers can bowl a maximum of 4 overs each, so a minimum of 5 bowlers must be present in every team. While t20 initially started as being tolerant of some of the overs being bowled by part-timers and <span>&#39;</span>bits-and-pieces<span>&#39;</span> allrounders, the greater professionalism, analytics and ruthless targeting of real or perceived <span>&#39;</span>weak-links<span>&#39;</span> has meant that teams often need 5 bona-fide bowling specialists, plus ideally one or two more options in case a bowler has an off day or a batter has a favorable match-up.<br>
                            In recent years, with more t20 leagues and greater analytics, T20 thinking has evolved to be more focused on roles and situational cricket, with players evolving to be increasingly specialized around excelling in specific situations that regularly occur in matches. No plan survives first contact with the enemy, so a well built-team will have contingencies and resources to adapt and exploit every situation that they face in t20 cricket. With that being said, let<span>&#39;</span>s dive into some of the better recognized roles in the team.<br>
                            
                            <br>
                        </p>
                        <h3>Batting Roles:</h3>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Opener - Anchor: </strong>  This is typically occupied by the best all-round batter on the team and is tasked with surviving the opening bowlers, rotating the strike and opportunistically scoring when the bowler errs. An anchor is given some discretion to defend or even leave dangerous balls early on as he is expected to build a long innings. The anchor is the player in t20 that is given the most freedom to <span>&#39;</span>play their natural game<span>&#39;</span> and so is best suited for naturally aggressive and highly talented player. An anchor should ideally aim to score between 7-8 runs an over early on and accelerate through the innings as he gets settled in and gets favorable matchups against change bowlers. Great examples of batters who played this role are: <strong> Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul, Ruturaj Gaikwad</strong>, and <strong> Shaun Marsh</strong>. All these batters have very high batting averages (for t20) and decent strike rates (~130-135) and the best ones are capable of batting through and scoring centuries <br><br>
                            <strong>Opener - Aggressor: </strong> In contrast to the anchor opener, the aggressor is tasked with batting with intent and exploiting the greater scoring opportunity offered by the Powerplay field restrictions, the hard new ball and bowlers that are still finding rhythm early in the innings. Aggressor players are also typically specialist batsmen, but often tend to skew younger or be overseas specialists as it takes rare talent and quick hands to quickly pick up the length and swing of new ball spearheads and confidently take the attack to them. Aggressor openers are expected to score at between 9-11 runs an over depending on match-up and will often actively look to unsettle bowlers by moving around the crease and hitting over the infield. In some cases, a pinch hitter like <strong>Sunil Narine</strong> may be sent to exploit matchups or create a favorable one for his partner (e.g. Narine is excellent at hitting spinners in the Powerplay, so can complement a batter who prefers attacking pace). Left handed batsmen often have a slight edge in the aggressor role as bowlers have to adjust their lines and strategy, and a left-right combination is more favorable to the batting team than a right-right combination. Good examples of players who fill the aggressor role include: <strong>Chris Gayle, Ishan Kishan, Prithvi Shaw, Jonny Bairstow</strong> and <strong>Jos Buttler</strong>. Having deeper batting lineups often emboldens openers to be more enterprising and bat more positively and is especially beneficial for the aggressor opener<br><br>
                            <strong>Number 3 - Helmsman: </strong>The number 3 is the key player who is tasked with assessing the situation and steering the entire innings regardless of the situation he finds himself in. Teams with short or brittle batting lineups (i.e. long tail or inconsistent/ green batters) may choose to put their best batter at 3 (or even 4) rather than opening to reduce the risk of losing them to a <span>&#39;</span>magic ball<span>&#39;</span> or reduce their exposure to a dangerous opposing bowler. In this case, the number 3 is a more focused version of the Anchor opener, equally able to come in and stabilize the situation from 2/1 in the first over as keeping the momentum going without undue risk at 100/1 in the 11th over. Good examples of the anchor number three includes <strong>Kane Williamson</strong> and <strong>Shreyas Iyer.</strong> Both these players still maintained excellent average in addition to their relatively high strike rates. A good number 3 should be able to score easily at 8-9 runs an over even with the field back, and have the skill and technique to negotiate a sharp spell in case they come in after an early wicket. Teams with historically deeper lineups were able to use more naturally aggressive batsmen at number three in a similar role - with <strong>Suresh Raina</strong> and <strong>Suryakumar Yadav</strong> being excellent examples of the archetype.<br><br>
                            <strong>Number 4 - Exploiter:  </strong> In an ideal scenario, the number 4 walks in in the 13th over, knocks around a few balls to settle in before teeing off. However, a number 4 must also have the skill to hunker down and play out a difficult spell or period of play to prevent a possible collapse. Number 4s must be able to attack spinners effectively, but increasingly as teams have evolved to include the bowling enforcer role to control the middle overs the ability to score against tall, fast bowlers hitting hard lengths has been necessary for success. The best number 4s have the innings building skills of a good anchor/helmsman along with the power-hitting and quick starting and ability of a finisher. <strong>AB de Villiers</strong> is the ideal archetype of a number 4, but <strong>Glenn Maxwell, Sanju Samson</strong> and <strong>Rishabh Pant</strong> are also excellent examples. In some cases, ageing finishers who have lost their quick start ability move up to number 4 to give themselves a little more time to settle in before attacking. We saw this with <strong>Mahendra Singh Dhoni</strong> and <strong>Eoin Morgan</strong> in recent years with varying levels of success.<br><br>
                            <strong>Number 5/6/7 - Finishers </strong> Given that there are only 120 balls in an innings, a number 5 should not expect to face more than 30 balls in most situations, with 6 and 7 facing fewer still. However, a finisher is an essential t20 role, with great finishers able to add an extra 20 runs to a team<span>&#39;</span>s total. Finishers must be able to get set and attack immediately, remain unfazed by pressure of rising asking rates and out-think death bowling specialists. The best specialist finishers include <strong>Mahendra Singh Dhoni</strong> and <strong>Kieron Pollard</strong>, and it is no coincidence that the teams they have been a part of are perennial playoff contenders and champions. Number 6 and 7 are often all-rounders but retain the ability to power-hit at the death. Great examples at number 6 include <strong>Ravindra Jadeja, Andre Russell</strong> and <strong>Hardik Pandya.</strong> Finally number 7 are usually specialist bowlers with some power hitting ability - good examples here are <strong>Axar Patel, Dwayne Bravo</strong> and <strong>Krunal Pandya</strong><br><br>
                            <strong>Number 8-11 - Tail Enders</strong> numbers 8-11 are almost always pure specialist bowlers should not bat often unless something has gone horribly wrong, but a tail-ender<span>&#39;</span>s ability to bat can have a strong psychological impact on the intent with which earlier batters play with. Chennai Super Kings often had solid batting talents like Shardul Thakur and Deepak Chahar batting as deep at no.9 (amazingly, the duo have combined for more matches played (106) than balls faced (89) for CSK despite demonstrating strong batting at the international level). However, this tremendous depth is likely a major factor behind CSK<span>&#39;</span>s top order batting more freely and aggressively and helping them post 22 200+ totals in the IPL (second only to RCB<span>&#39;</span> 23 - note RCB has played 2 more IPL seasons than CSK).<br><br>

                            <strong>Conclusion: </strong> While these roles define a starting point of a team's team-building and line-up construction process, most professional batters can and do play multiple roles and switch roles in games or even within an innings. Batting partners who work well together frequently identify favorable matchups and switch roles as opportunities come up in the innings. Some teams even have an 'emergency' anchor who nominally bats at number 3 or 4 but only comes in if there are quick wickets or challenging conditions (e.g. Steve Smith for Aus in T20WC 2021). One of the hypothesized reasons for the Indian men's national team's relative underperformance in ICC T20 World cups relative to their talent and depth is that their team is often comprised of their best overall batsmen, who are all often given the Anchor role for their IPL teams where they can maximize their run scoring opportunity. As a result, the Indian lineup in the 2021 world cup featured 4 players who open for their IPL teams in their playing XI in KL Rahul, Ishan Kishan, Rohit Sharma, and Virat Kohli. Aligning roles across international and IPL responsibilities may lead to greater success for both the international and IPL team <br>
